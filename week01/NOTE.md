## Front-end Developer learning techniques
    - Front-end skill model
        - Feild knowledge (depend on job or porduct)
        - Front-end specific knowlege (recreate ui from mockup ...)
        - Programming skill
        - Architect skill
        - Engineering skill
    - Method of learning
        1. Orginized relationship between different pieces of knowldge
            - Ordered relationship
            - Combination relationship
            - Dimensional relationship
            - Sub-set relationship
            - Full set
        2. Back track, find what is the origin of this piece of knowldge, find standard and documention and reputable person in this area

## Front-end Engineering System
	- Create career plan
	- All knowledge must be in a system
	- Different view on your job
		- product view
		- solve technical challenge
		- engineering 
	- Data driven thinking
	- Tool chain
		- version control
	- Front-end build is fast , check in build, add lint and rule check
	- Front end architecture
		- reusable component, code, module
		- most reused code
			- url (read and anyalize url)
			- AJAX
			- ENV (detect device environment)
		- UI component
		- different module by different product
